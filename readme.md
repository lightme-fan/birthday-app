Hello 

This is my week project;

- Firstly, I could not import the **date-fns** in my script page.

- I set all my work in one big function.

1. I declare an empty array 
2. I fetch the list of people, the push it as the value of the empty array.
3. I set the new array of object to local storage.
4. I create a template to calculate the age of those people in new array of oject. 
5. I display the new array of object from local storage by mapping it. I also call the created age template to get the age of everybody.
6. I declare a destroy popup function.
7. After that the edit function
8. Delete function
9. Add function

**I separated all my functions into different files.**

### The most challenging in this project are: 
 - to work with the date.
 - Sorting those people by the soonest birthday.

*I tried to calculate the number of days from now untill the birthday. I got numbers but it is the birthday this year. Some of the birthdays have gone, so some are negative numbers.*

## What I still need to improve is:
* to search a person by lastName or firstName or month of birthday. I still want a short explanation because I don't fully understand it.

*I spent a lot of time to refactor my code because after I have refactored it I have many bugs.*

Thanks for this challenge. I found this difficult but it is fan.

👍 🙂 🙂  👍
